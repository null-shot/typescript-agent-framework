Welcome to a new paradigm in AI development. MCP provides the foundation for building intelligent, interoperable agents that can communicate, evolve, and generate value at the edge of the network.

## Vision

We're extending [Cloudflare's vision for AI Agents](https://blog.cloudflare.com/making-cloudflare-the-best-platform-for-ai-agents) with a focus on web3 and MCPs as plugins:

- 🤝 AI Agents as teammates/organizations generating revenue and performing advanced operations
- 💰 Cost-effective shared hosting options
- 🔒 Secure sensitive assets (trading agents, treasuries, etc.)
- 📈 Self-improving agents based on collective usage
- 💸 Drive MCP usage revenue to open source contributors
- 💼 Monetization avenues for closed-source MCP use cases
- ⚙️ Seamless configuration options
- 🚀 Quick iteration on ideas locally and in-cloud
- 🔓 No vendor lock-in, self-hosting and personal account options

## Project Status

This project is in pre-alpha and actively evolving. Current focus areas:

### Ready for Use

- ✅ Core MCP Framework
- ✅ Multi Session & Authentication Patterns
- ✅ Official MCP WebSocket Support and HTTP Streaming Support
- ✅ Agent Framework (AI SDK)
- ✅ Seamless MCP Plugins (mcp.json) for Agents
= ✅ Playground UI for LLMs + MCPs

### In Development

- ☁️ Cloudflare Service Examples (KV, D1, DO state, Analytics, Workflows, Schema Migrations)
- 🤖 LangChain and Agent SDK examples coming soon
- 📄 Cloudflare Pages (SSE / Fullstack) Examples
- 🔑 Authentication (OAuth, JWT)

## Quick Start

🚧 Coming Soon! We're working hard to provide a seamless getting started experience.

## Documentation

📚 Coming Soon! Comprehensive documentation and guides are under development.

## Release Process

This repository uses an automated release workflow following semantic versioning:

1. **Pull Request Testing** - When you create a PR, it automatically runs tests and a semantic-release dry run
2. **Automated Publishing** - When merged to main, changed packages are automatically published to npm
3. **Versioning** - Package versions are determined by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standards

For detailed information about our release process, see [.github/RELEASE_PROCESS.md](.github/RELEASE_PROCESS.md).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Our vision is to create a collaborative ecosystem where AI and human developers work together. Soon, we'll have an AI agent to audit and govern contributions based on our shared vision.
