Welcome to a new paradigm in AI development. MCP provides the foundation for building intelligent, interoperable agents that can communicate, evolve, and generate value at the edge of the network.

## Vision

We're extending [Cloudflare's vision for AI Agents](https://blog.cloudflare.com/making-cloudflare-the-best-platform-for-ai-agents) with a focus on web3 and MCPs as plugins:

- 🤝 AI Agents as teammates/organizations generating revenue and performing advanced operations
- 💰 Cost-effective shared hosting options
- 🔒 Secure sensitive assets (trading agents, treasuries, etc.)
- 📈 Self-improving agents based on collective usage
- 💸 Drive MCP usage revenue to open source contributors
- 💼 Monetization avenues for closed-source MCP use cases
- ⚙️ Seamless configuration options
- 🚀 Quick iteration on ideas locally and in-cloud
- 🔓 No vendor lock-in, self-hosting and personal account options

## Project Status

This project is in pre-alpha and actively evolving. Current focus areas:

### Ready for Use

- ✅ Core MCP Framework
- ✅ Multi Session & Authentication Patterns

### In Development

- 🔄 Official MCP WebSocket Support and HTTP Streaming Support
- ☁️ Cloudflare Service Examples (KV, D1, DO state, Analytics, Workflows, Schema Migrations)
- 🤖 Agent Framework (AI SDK, LangChain Examples)
- 📄 Cloudflare Pages (SSE / Fullstack) Examples
- 🔌 MCP Plugins
- 🔑 Authentication (OAuth, JWT)

## Quick Start
