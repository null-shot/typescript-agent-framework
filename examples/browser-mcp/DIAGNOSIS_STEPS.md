# Browser MCP Timeout Diagnosis

## You're Right - 10 Seconds IS Long!

A 10-second timeout should be more than enough for most websites. The fact that it's timing out suggests:

1. **Browser Rendering Service Issues**
2. **Network connectivity problems** 
3. **Cloudflare Workers Browser Rendering not properly configured**
4. **Geographic restrictions or blocking**

## Quick Diagnosis Steps

### 1. Test with Fastest Possible Site
```json
{
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/html",
  "selector": "body",
  "timeout": 5000
}
```

### 2. Test with Google (Should be instant)
```json
{
  "url": "https://www.google.com",
  "selector": "title",
  "timeout": 5000
}
```

### 3. Check if Browser Rendering is Working at All
```json
{
  "url": "data:text/html,<html><body><h1>Test</h1></body></html>",
  "selector": "body"
}
```

## Likely Root Causes

### 1. Browser Rendering Service Not Enabled
- Check if Cloudflare Browser Rendering is enabled in your account
- Verify billing/subscription includes Browser Rendering
- Check if you're in a supported region

### 2. Worker Configuration Issues
- Browser binding might not be properly configured
- Environment variables missing
- Wrangler configuration problems

### 3. Network/Infrastructure Issues
- Cloudflare Workers having connectivity issues
- DNS resolution problems
- Firewall/proxy blocking requests

## Expected Behavior
- **Google.com should load in < 2 seconds**
- **HTTPBin should load in < 1 second**
- **Data URLs should be instant**

If these simple tests fail, it's definitely an infrastructure issue, not a timeout problem.

## Next Steps Based on Results

### If Simple Tests Fail:
1. Check Cloudflare account Browser Rendering status
2. Verify worker deployment and bindings
3. Check Cloudflare status page for outages

### If Simple Tests Work:
1. The issue is with specific websites (HKO, TimeAndDate)
2. Try alternative time sources
3. Use two-step process (navigate + extract)

## Alternative: Check Worker Logs
Look for error messages in the Cloudflare Workers dashboard that might indicate what's actually failing.
