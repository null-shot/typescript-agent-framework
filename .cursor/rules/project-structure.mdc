# Project Structure

This project is structured as a monorepo using yarn workspaces. The main structure is as follows:

- `packages/`: Contains all the project packages
  - `mcp/`: The main MCP (Model Context Protocol) implementation for Cloudflare Workers
  - `test-utils/`: Utilities for testing

- `examples/`: Contains example implementations
  - `crud-mcp/`: An example CRUD application using the MCP framework

- `src/`: Contains shared source files for the root project

## Key Files

- Main package: [packages/mcp/src/index.ts](mdc:packages/mcp/src/index.ts)
- MCP Server implementation: [packages/mcp/src/mcp/server.ts](mdc:packages/mcp/src/mcp/server.ts)
- Example application: [examples/crud-mcp/src/index.ts](mdc:examples/crud-mcp/src/index.ts)

## Development Workflow

1. Install dependencies at the root level: `yarn install`
2. Build all packages: `yarn build`
3. Run tests: `yarn test`
4. To develop specific packages, navigate to their directory and use their specific scripts
